# myntra-sales-analysis-sql
SQL-based sales analysis project using a sample Myntra sales dataset to identify order trends and product performance.


# Myntra Sales Analysis (SQL)

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL to understand order patterns, product performance, and basic sales trends.  
The goal of the project is to practice SQL querying skills and demonstrate analytical thinking through a structured sales analysis use case.


## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is a **sample sales dataset** sourced from a publicly available GitHub repository shared by a YouTube content creator for educational purposes.

The dataset contains a limited number of records and is intentionally used to focus on SQL logic, query design, and insight generation rather than large-scale data processing.



# Tools and Technologies
- SQL
- Relational Database Concepts
- MySQL / PostgreSQL (any SQL-compatible database)



# Analysis Performed
The following types of analysis were performed using SQL queries:

- Basic exploration of sales data
- Order and product-level analysis
- Sales trend identification
- Aggregation and grouping using SQL functions
- Filtering data to answer business-related questions


# Key Learnings
- Writing structured SQL queries for analysis
- Using aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG
- Applying GROUP BY and WHERE clauses effectively
- Understanding how sales data can be analyzed for business insights


# Files Included
- `myntra_sales_analysis.sql` – SQL queries used for analysis  
- `early_sales.csv` – Sample sales dataset used in the project  


# Project Purpose
This project is created as a **learning and portfolio project** for practicing SQL skills.  
The same analytical approach demonstrated here can be applied to larger datasets in real-world business scenarios.
